Pipedrive / TalTech workshop, 19.05.2021

# creating you first microservice with NodeJS

during the workshop we've created a simple RESTful API-service, that can store notes. It uses `koa` web framework (successor of well known `express.js`), `@koa-router` for routing, `koa-bodyparser` for parsing request body and `koa-logger` for logging incoming requests. `Joi` validates what JSON service receives upon POST request, `knexjs` helps us with building SQL queries and `mysql2` ensures communication with database. We use `nodemon` for hot-reloading during development.

## ‚öôÔ∏è API

list of endpoints:

`GET /health` - checks whether service is healthy

`GET /api/notes` - returns list of all the notes

`GET /api/notes/:id` - returns a single note, by given `id`

`POST /api/notes` - creates a note. Expects JSON to be present in the body of the request, with `text` field in it

`DELETE /api/notes/:id` - deletes a note, by given `id`

## üöÄ How to run the app

there are two ways to run the app, simplest one using `docker compose`. Start with cloning this repository, and make sure you have `node` and `docker` installed.

(ü§´ shh, you don't need to have `node` installed if you're running the app via `docker`. That's the beauty of it)

### option 1: via `docker compose`

to start app and db containers, run:
```
docker compose up
```

after both containers are up and running, execute this to setup database:

```
docker exec -it taltech-app npm run db-setup
```

that's it! App will be running at `localhost:3002`

### option 2: running the app locally

since we still be using MySQL server in a docker container, before running the app inself, let's run mysql server in the container, that docker will pull from DockerHub:

```
docker run --rm -d --name=taltech-db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -p 3306:3306 mysql:5.7
```

now let's install all dependencies:

```
npm install
```

and setup database:

```
npm run db-setup
```

after this is done, let's run the app:

```
npm run dev
```

voila! App will be running at `localhost:3000`

## Useful commands

if you think you've messed something up with all those docker containers and images - this command will clean up your docker enviromnent, by deleting all containers and images:
```
docker rm -vf $(docker ps -a -q) && docker rmi -f $(docker images -a -q)
```

other than that:

`docker ps`  - shows list of running docker containers

`docker ps -a` - shows list of running and stopped docker containers

`docker image list`- shows available docker images 

`docker stop [container id or name]` - stops docker container

`docker rm [ontainer id or name]` - removes docker container

`docker image rm [image id or tag]` - removes docker image locally
